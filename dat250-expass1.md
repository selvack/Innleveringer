# Problems under installation

When I tried to install Homebrew on my system i got an warning saying that ``opt/homebrew/bin is not in your PATH``
At the end of the installation log the system responded
```sh
=> Next steps: 
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/selvakumar/.zprofile 
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)" 
```

then my brew was installed
``brew -v ``
``Homebrew 3.5.10``
``Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 26b52fe6a6f; last commit 2022-08-25``


#### 2. Java
When i tried to install java through brew i got the error message

ran this command

# Setting up Git and Heroku
Signed up for github and Heroku
